## Create a recursive function

  1. Create a recursive function which counts up to ```10```. 
  2. Invoke the function with different start numbers as the arguments that are passed into the function. 
  3. The function should run until the value is greater than ```10```.

## Set timeout order

  1. Use the arrow format to create functions which output the values one and two to the console. 
  2. Create a third function which outputs the value three to the console, and then invokes the first two functions.
  3. Create a fourth function which outputs the word four to the console and also use ```setTimeout()``` to invoke the first function immediately and then the third function.

What does your output look like in the console? Try to get the console to output:

```
Four
Three
One
Two
One
```
